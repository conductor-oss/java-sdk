# Spin up a local Conductor OSS stack and run the `tests` module's
# integration suite against it, mirroring the `integration-tests-oss` job in
# .github/workflows/integration-tests.yml. Orkes-Enterprise-only test
# classes are annotated with
# @DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable(named = "CONDUCTOR_SERVER_TYPE", matches = "oss")
# so they skip themselves when it's set (see the individual test files for
# the empirically-confirmed gaps).
#
# The stack (Conductor OSS + Postgres) is defined in
# scripts/docker-compose-oss.yaml and is torn down automatically on exit. That
# file's `image:` line is also where the default tag lives -- this script
# applies no default of its own, so a plain run and a fork-PR CI run land on
# the identical image. The image is always pulled before starting, since a tag
# can be mutable and a cached copy would otherwise go stale silently.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run-integration-oss.sh [--keep-up] [--version <tag>] [--include-gated] [-- gradle args]
# Examples:
#   scripts/run-integration-oss.sh                       # default tag from the compose file
#   scripts/run-integration-oss.sh --version 3.33.0-rc1
#   scripts/run-integration-oss.sh --keep-up
#   scripts/run-integration-oss.sh --include-gated       # also run tests normally skipped as Orkes-only
#   scripts/run-integration-oss.sh -- --tests "*WorkflowClientTests"
